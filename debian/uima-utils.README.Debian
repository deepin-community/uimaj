UIMA in Debian
==============

To ease user and system's administrator work, we set "org.apache.uima.jarpath"
system property to include the following directories:
 * /usr/share/uima/components/
 * /usr/local/share/uima/components/
 * $HOME/.uima/components/

This will allow UIMA to include every JAR in those directories directly in its
classpath (for PEAR components for examples).
