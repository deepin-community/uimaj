This document explains how to develop and use components providing
SOAP web service or using it within the UIMA framework.

When compiling and running apps using the UIMA framework and especially
the SOAP connecter, you need to add "/usr/share/java/uimaj-adapter-soap.jar"
to the CLASSPATH.  E.g.

    export CLASSPATH="/usr/share/java/uimaj-adapter-soap.jar:/usr/share/java:."
    javac Whatever.java
    java Whatever
