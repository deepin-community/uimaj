    Common Analysis System (CAS) Interfaces.

    <p>

The CAS provides data modelling, definition and retrieval.  The data model is stored
in a <a href="TypeSystem.html">type system</a>.  Use factory methods on a 
<a href="CAS.html">CAS</a> object to create data structures.  Also from a CAS, you
can access the <a href="FSIndexRepository.html">index repository</a> to retrieve
the data structure that have already been created.
